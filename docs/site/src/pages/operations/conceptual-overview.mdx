# What is Synnax?
Synnax is a sensor-data platform that allows data storage, processing, analysis,
viewing, and automated control. What that means is that Synnax can connect to
hardware systems, collect data, and allow users to both plot the data and run
automated control with the data.

# How does Synnax work?
The most important thing to know about Synnax how Synnax works is that it
consists of two main parts, nodes and clusters. _Nodes_ are an individual instance
of Synnax running - think of an individual computer running the Synnax console,
or an individual instance of an automated control server. Nodes that are
connected to each other form a _cluster_. Every node in the cluster has access to
the same data, and is able to save shared views such as line graphs or PID
views.
