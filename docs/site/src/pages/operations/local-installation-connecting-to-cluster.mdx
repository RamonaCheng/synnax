# Local Installation of Synnax

There are two different versions of Synnax that can be installed. The first
version, the Synnax server, should be installed and run by the computer that is
hosting the server. The second version, the Synnax console, is a desktop
application that should be installed and run on any computer looking to use
Synnax. Both of these can be found on the [Synnax releases
page](https://github.com/synnaxlabs/synnax/releases). Note that the servers are
labeled Synnax vX.X.X, and the console versions are labeled Synnax __Console__
vX.X.X. Information on how to install and run the server is covered in the
Synnax Deployment documentation page [link].

To install the latest version of the console, download the appropriate file for
your operating system on the console page. Run the latest version of the
installer. Trust the file and run the installer. You should then be able to
launch the Synnax console from your computer. You should see the following page
below.

To connect to a cluster, first click the "Connect a Cluster" button. The
following window should then pop up:

%%%% Insert "connect a cluster" popup box %%%%

are connecting to the local cluster, the Name will be the name used for
launchign the cluster, the Host will be localhost, the port will be 9090. The
default parameters for Username are synnax and Password is seldon. If other

%% Insert paragraph on what a workspace is
Next, you will be prompted to create a workspace. A workspace is a collection of
visualizations, either line plots or P&ID diagrams. You can save visualizations
as part of a workspace so all members of the cluster can view a certain
workspace. To switch between workspaces, you can choose a different workspace in
the resources tree or click on a different workspace in the top left.


To visualize data in your workspace, there are two main types of visualizations.
The first is called a "Line Plot", and is a line graph that allows you to plot
line charts together. The second type of view is called a "PID view". This,
which stands for piping and instrumentation diagram, allows you to make a
schematic of your system with live values that pop up on it.

In the resources tab on the top left, there are several folders. 
- __Channels__ are the sensor channels that you can track and plot.
- __Ranges__ are saved times that you can use when loading data to view. For
  instance, you can save the time of a test as a range with name Test 1, and
  then load that range on the line plot view when looking at data.
- __Users__ are a list of all users logged into the cluster. The workspaces
  created by the users can be found underneath their name.
- __Workspaces__ list all created workspaces in the cluster. This includes
  workspaces created by all users.
