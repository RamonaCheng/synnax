# Node

A node is a running instance of the Synnax database. It is a single executable
that can run on Windows, Linux, MacOS, or inside of a Container. A node's primary 
responsibility is to permanently store and serve sensor data to users. 

It's important to note that a node is not the same thing as the Synnax Console UI. The 
Console UI contains a local node embedded inside for single person usage of Synnax. For
deployment in a multi-user organization, it's common to run a node on a separate server
and have multiple users connect to it via the console UI.
