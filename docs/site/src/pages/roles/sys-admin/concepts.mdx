## Deployment Concepts

## Introduction

This page guides System Administrators through the essential concepts need to deploy
Synnax effectively in a production environment. This page will conceptually address
the topology of a Synnax deployment (clusters, nodes), and the considerations that
should be taken into account when deploying Synnax (workload, networking, security, etc.).
This page will also link to more detailed guides on specific deployment workloads.

## Key Terms

### Node

A node is a running instance of the Synnax database. It is a single executable
that can run on Windows, Linux, MacOS, or inside of a container. A node's primary
responsibility is to permanently store and serve sensor data to users. It's useful
to think of a node as the heart of a Synnax deployment. All traffic related to data
recording, control sequences, etc. is routed through and processed by a node.

It's important to note that a node is not the same thing as the Synnax Console UI. The
Console UI contains a local node embedded inside for single person usage of Synnax. For
deployment in a multi-user organization, it's common to run a node on a separate server
and have multiple users connect to it via the console UI.

### Cluster

A cluster is a group of interconnected nodes that work together in order to function as
a single Synnax database. Nodes within a cluster will coordinate reads and writes of data
to distribute data storage and processing. This allows a cluster to scale horizontally,
growing to meet the needs of its application.

The smallest possible cluster is a single node. While a single node cluster has less
fault tolerance than a multi-node cluster, it's perfectly okay to deploy Synnax in
production with just a single node. As your needs grow, you can add additional nodes
in order to balance the workload.

It's important to note that multi-node clusters are experimental and not yet recommended
for production use.

## Deployment Considerations

### Workload

Perhaps the most important consideration when deploying Synnax is the workload that
you expect to place on your cluster. Synnax is designed to handle very data intensive
operations, but performance is ultimately limited by the specifications of the hardware
you deploy it on and the quality of the network used for communication.

The workloads that Synnax serves are generally split into two categories: real-time
hardware operations and long term data storage. We'll address each of these in turn.

#### Real-Time Hardware Operations

When using Synnax to control hardware, network stability and latency are the most
critical concerns. We recommend deploying Synnax on a local network with a dedicated
switch and high quality, well-protected cabling. Generally speaking, it's best to
deploy Synnax as close to the hardware as possible.

For single node clusters, we typically see our users deploy Synnax on the same computer
that their data acquisition devices are connected.

We caution against using a cloud deployment or any public network for real-time hardware
operations, as this poses a significant risk to the stability of your system, and exposes
your cluster to potential security threats.

#### Long Term Data Storage

When using Synnax for long term data storage or low-rate live data streaming
(less than 5 samples per second), network stability and latency are less critical,
and the primary concern becomes sustainable, scalable storage capacity and maximum
availability to users.

Our customers typically deploy Synnax on-prem within their own data centers, although
deploying Synnax in the cloud with a publicly exposed endpoint is also a viable option.
Synnax can run on bare metal, virtual machines, or you can use our docker images to
deploy Synnax in a containerized environment.

### Networking

Synnax uses two communication protocols: HTTP and gRPC. Understanding the details of
these protocols is not necessary for deploying Synnax. What's relevant is that they both
use standard TCP/IP networking.

All Synnax nodes expose themselves to traffic on a **single port**, which is configurable
at runtime. This port is used for cluster internal communication between nodes, as well
as for processing incoming requests from clients (console UI, control sequences,
analysis scripts, device drivers, etc.).

When running in production, we recommend encrypting all traffic to and from your Synnax
cluster with SSL/TLS. See the [Security](#security) section for more details.
