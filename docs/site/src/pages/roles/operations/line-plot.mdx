import { Image } from "@/components/Media";

The line plot visualization is the main visualization tool in Synnax. In this
visualization, you can graph data. An example visualization is shown below:

<Image client:only="react" id="roles/operations/line-plot/line-plot-main-view"  />

Make sure to click the graph button in the bottom right corner to pop up the
visualization properties.

## Data Tab
The data tab has several properties underneath it:
- Y1 lets you select which channels to plot along the left-hand axis
- Y2 lets you select which channels to plot along the right-hand axis
- Ranges lets you select which time ranges to plot. Data will only be plotted
  that took place over these time ranges. If you select multiple ranges, the
  x-axis will scale to accomodate both.
    - _Rolling_ time ranges allow you to view the most recent time increment of
      data. These are intented for cases where the user wants live data to come
      into the line plot.
- X1 lets you select the x-axis to be scaled by a channel instead of time. Note
  that only data that will be viewed will be the data from the selected time
  range.

## Line Tab
The line tab has several properties underneath it:
- Label allows you to change what text appears for the channels in the graph
  legend.
- Line width lets you change how many pixels the lines are.
- Downsampling lets you change how many times the channels get plotted. If
  downsampling is n, it plots every nth data point.
- Color changes the color of the line on the graph.

## Axes Tab
The axes tab has several properties underneath it:
- Lower bound and upper bound decides the limits for the axes.
- Tick spacing determines how far apart the tick marks are.
- If you add a label, this will add a title to the axis.
- Label direction determines whether the letters in the label are vertical or
  horizontal.
- Label size determines the size of the label.

## Properties Tab
The properties tab has several properties underneath it:
- Title allows you to change the title of the plot. This will change it in the
  workspace tab and on the top of the graph.
- The title switch determines whether the title is viewed in the chart.
- The legend switch determines whether the legend is viewed in the chart.

## Navigating the plot
- Zoom on the plot by clicking the magnifying glass in the bottom left or by
  Alt (Windows) / ‚å• (Mac) + left click. This will adjust the axes of the graph to the box made.
- Pan the plot by clicking the arrows in the bottom left or by pressing shift +
  left click.
- Select data by clicking the box with dotted lines in the bottom left or by
  left clicking and dragging. This box allows you to export data in various
  formats.
- Reset the zoom by clicking the bracketed box in the bottom left or by clicking
  ^ + Left Click.
- Show tooltip on hover enables you to hover over the graph and see all channel
  values at a certain data point.
- Slope allows you to click two points on the graph and calculate the slope
  in between them. It also allows you to see the difference in the x and the y
  axis. To change the first point, press the 1 key and click on the graph. To
  change the second point, press the 2 key and click on the graph.
- Pause live plotting, also accessible by the H key, freezes any live plotting.
