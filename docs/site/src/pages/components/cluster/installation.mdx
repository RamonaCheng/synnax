## Installing on Linux

To install Synnax on a Linux distribution, run the following command to download the latest
binary:

<SynnaxDownloadURL os="linux"  />

We recommend you move the binary into a directory that is in your `PATH`. Most of our users
use `/usr/local/bin`:

<SynnaxMoveCommand os="linux" />

If `usr/local/bin` is not in your `PATH`, you can temporarily add it by running the following

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

Or, you can add it permanently using the following one liner for your shell:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or, for `zsh`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

If any previous versions of Synnax are installed and available on your `PATH`, you
may need to remove them to avoid conflicts.

Next, give execution permissions to the binary:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/synnax
```

You may need to use `sudo` to run the above command if you do not have the 
necessary permissions.

To verify that the installation was successful, run:

```bash
synnax --version
```
